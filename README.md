ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @btuffreau ! I'm a nerd, shhh don't tell my wife :cupid:

ðŸ‘€ I'm a big fan of tech, from infrastructure to dev with a taste for data engineering :nerd_face: but who knows what tomorrow will be made of? 


My current contribution is :baby: , see sample below:

```package main
  
import (
        "fmt"
        "time"
        "math/rand"
)


func main() {

        var max int = 180
        fmt.Println(variable)

        for{
                rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano())
                n := rand.Intn(max)
                fmt.Printf("Baby's falling asleep for %d minutes ...\n", n)
                time.Sleep(time.Duration(n)*time.Second/10)
                fmt.Println("Changing nappy!")
        }
}
```


You'll find me on slack or here on github, don't hesitate to reach out!
